<!--END STABILITY BANNER-->

This package contains constructs for working with **Amazon Elastic Container
Service** (Amazon ECS).

Amazon ECS is a highly scalable, fast, container management service
that makes it easy to run, stop,
and manage Docker containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.

For further information on Amazon ECS,
see the [Amazon ECS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecs)

The following example creates an Amazon ECS cluster,
adds capacity to it,
and instantiates the Amazon ECS Service with an automatic load balancer.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_ecs as ecs

# Create an ECS cluster
cluster = ecs.Cluster(self, "Cluster",
    vpc=vpc
)

# Add capacity to it
cluster.add_capacity("DefaultAutoScalingGroupCapacity",
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t2.xlarge"),
    desired_capacity=3
)

task_definition = ecs.Ec2TaskDefinition(self, "TaskDef")

task_definition.add_container("DefaultContainer",
    image=ecs.ContainerImage.from_registry("amazon/amazon-ecs-sample"),
    memory_limit_mi_b=512
)

# Instantiate an Amazon ECS Service
ecs_service = ecs.Ec2Service(self, "Service",
    cluster=cluster,
    task_definition=task_definition
)
```

For a set of constructs defining common ECS architectural patterns, see the `@aws-cdk/aws-ecs-patterns` package.

## Launch Types: AWS Fargate vs Amazon EC2

There are two sets of constructs in this library; one to run tasks on Amazon EC2 and
one to run tasks on AWS Fargate.

* Use the `Ec2TaskDefinition` and `Ec2Service` constructs to run tasks on Amazon EC2 instances running in your account.
* Use the `FargateTaskDefinition` and `FargateService` constructs to run tasks on
  instances that are managed for you by AWS.

Here are the main differences:

* **Amazon EC2**: instances are under your control. Complete control of task to host
  allocation. Required to specify at least a memory reseration or limit for
  every container. Can use Host, Bridge and AwsVpc networking modes. Can attach
  Classic Load Balancer. Can share volumes between container and host.
* **AWS Fargate**: tasks run on AWS-managed instances, AWS manages task to host
  allocation for you. Requires specification of memory and cpu sizes at the
  taskdefinition level. Only supports AwsVpc networking modes and
  Application/Network Load Balancers. Only the AWS log driver is supported.
  Many host features are not supported such as adding kernel capabilities
  and mounting host devices/volumes inside the container.

For more information on Amazon EC2 vs AWS Fargate and networking see the AWS Documentation:
[AWS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html) and
[Task Networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html).

## Clusters

A `Cluster` defines the infrastructure to run your
tasks on. You can run many tasks on a single cluster.

The following code creates a cluster that can run AWS Fargate tasks:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
cluster = ecs.Cluster(self, "Cluster",
    vpc=vpc
)
```

To use tasks with Amazon EC2 launch-type, you have to add capacity to
the cluster in order for tasks to be scheduled on your instances.  Typically,
you add an AutoScalingGroup with instances running the latest
Amazon ECS-optimized AMI to the cluster. There is a method to build and add such an
AutoScalingGroup automatically, or you can supply a customized AutoScalingGroup
that you construct yourself. It's possible to add multiple AutoScalingGroups
with various instance types.

The following example creates an Amazon ECS cluster and adds capacity to it:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
cluster = ecs.Cluster(self, "Cluster",
    vpc=vpc
)

# Either add default capacity
cluster.add_capacity("DefaultAutoScalingGroupCapacity",
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t2.xlarge"),
    desired_capacity=3
)

# Or add customized capacity. Be sure to start the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI.
auto_scaling_group = autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t2.xlarge"),
    machine_image=EcsOptimizedImage.amazon_linux(),
    # Or use Amazon ECS-Optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI
    # machineImage: EcsOptimizedImage.amazonLinux2(),
    desired_capacity=3
)

cluster.add_auto_scaling_group(auto_scaling_group)
```

If you omit the property `vpc`, the construct will create a new VPC with two AZs.

### Bottlerocket

[Bottlerocket](https://aws.amazon.com/bottlerocket/) is a Linux-based open source operating system that is
purpose-built by AWS for running containers. You can launch Amazon ECS container instances with the Bottlerocket AMI.

> **NOTICE**: The Bottlerocket AMI is in developer preview release for Amazon ECS and is subject to change.

The following example will create a capacity with self-managed Amazon EC2 capacity of 2 `c5.large` Linux instances running with `Bottlerocket` AMI.

Note that you must specify either a `machineImage` or `machineImageType`, at least one, not both.

The following example adds Bottlerocket capacity to the cluster:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
cluster.add_capacity("bottlerocket-asg",
    min_capacity=2,
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("c5.large"),
    machine_image_type=ecs.MachineImageType.BOTTLEROCKET
)
```

### Spot Instances

To add spot instances into the cluster, you must specify the `spotPrice` in the `ecs.AddCapacityOptions` and optionally enable the `spotInstanceDraining` property.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# Add an AutoScalingGroup with spot instances to the existing cluster
cluster.add_capacity("AsgSpot",
    max_capacity=2,
    min_capacity=2,
    desired_capacity=2,
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("c5.xlarge"),
    spot_price="0.0735",
    # Enable the Automated Spot Draining support for Amazon ECS
    spot_instance_draining=True
)
```

### SNS Topic Encryption

When the `ecs.AddCapacityOptions` that you provide has a non-zero `taskDrainTime` (the default) then an SNS topic and Lambda are created to ensure that the
cluster's instances have been properly drained of tasks before terminating. The SNS Topic is sent the instance-terminating lifecycle event from the AutoScalingGroup,
and the Lambda acts on that event. If you wish to engage [server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-data-encryption.html) for this SNS Topic
then you may do so by providing a KMS key for the `topicEncryptionKey` propery of `ecs.AddCapacityOptions`.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# Given
key = kms.Key(...)
# Then, use that key to encrypt the lifecycle-event SNS Topic.
cluster.add_capacity("ASGEncryptedSNS",
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t2.xlarge"),
    desired_capacity=3,
    topic_encryption_key=key
)
```

## Task definitions

A task Definition describes what a single copy of a **task** should look like.
A task definition has one or more containers; typically, it has one
main container (the *default container* is the first one that's added
to the task definition, and it is marked *essential*) and optionally
some supporting containers which are used to support the main container,
doings things like upload logs or metrics to monitoring services.

To run a task or service with Amazon EC2 launch type, use the `Ec2TaskDefinition`. For AWS Fargate tasks/services, use the
`FargateTaskDefinition`. These classes provide a simplified API that only contain
properties relevant for that specific launch type.

For a `FargateTaskDefinition`, specify the task size (`memoryLimitMiB` and `cpu`):

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
fargate_task_definition = ecs.FargateTaskDefinition(self, "TaskDef",
    memory_limit_mi_b=512,
    cpu=256
)
```

To add containers to a task definition, call `addContainer()`:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
container = fargate_task_definition.add_container("WebContainer",
    # Use an image from DockerHub
    image=ecs.ContainerImage.from_registry("amazon/amazon-ecs-sample")
)
```

For a `Ec2TaskDefinition`:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
ec2_task_definition = ecs.Ec2TaskDefinition(self, "TaskDef",
    network_mode=NetworkMode.BRIDGE
)

container = ec2_task_definition.add_container("WebContainer",
    # Use an image from DockerHub
    image=ecs.ContainerImage.from_registry("amazon/amazon-ecs-sample"),
    memory_limit_mi_b=1024
)
```

You can specify container properties when you add them to the task definition, or with various methods, e.g.:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
container.add_port_mappings(
    container_port=3000
)
```

To add data volumes to a task definition, call `addVolume()`:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
volume = ecs.Volume("Volume",
    # Use an Elastic FileSystem
    name="mydatavolume",
    efs_volume_configuration=ecs.EfsVolumeConfiguration(
        file_system_id="EFS"
    )
)

container = fargate_task_definition.add_volume("mydatavolume")
```

To use a TaskDefinition that can be used with either Amazon EC2 or
AWS Fargate launch types, use the `TaskDefinition` construct.

When creating a task definition you have to specify what kind of
tasks you intend to run: Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, or both.
The following example uses both:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
task_definition = ecs.TaskDefinition(self, "TaskDef",
    memory_mi_b="512",
    cpu="256",
    network_mode=NetworkMode.AWS_VPC,
    compatibility=ecs.Compatibility.EC2_AND_FARGATE
)
```

### Images

Images supply the software that runs inside the container. Images can be
obtained from either DockerHub or from ECR repositories, or built directly from a local Dockerfile.

* `ecs.ContainerImage.fromRegistry(imageName)`: use a public image.
* `ecs.ContainerImage.fromRegistry(imageName, { credentials: mySecret })`: use a private image that requires credentials.
* `ecs.ContainerImage.fromEcrRepository(repo, tag)`: use the given ECR repository as the image
  to start. If no tag is provided, "latest" is assumed.
* `ecs.ContainerImage.fromAsset('./image')`: build and upload an
  image directly from a `Dockerfile` in your source directory.
* `ecs.ContainerImage.fromDockerImageAsset(asset)`: uses an existing
  `@aws-cdk/aws-ecr-assets.DockerImageAsset` as a container image.

### Environment variables

To pass environment variables to the container, you can use the `environment`, `environmentFiles`, and `secrets` props.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
task_definition.add_container("container",
    image=ecs.ContainerImage.from_registry("amazon/amazon-ecs-sample"),
    memory_limit_mi_b=1024,
    environment={# clear text, not for sensitive data
        "STAGE": "prod"},
    environment_files=[# list of environment files hosted either on local disk or S3
        ecs.EnvironmentFile.from_asset("./demo-env-file.env"),
        ecs.EnvironmentFile.from_bucket(s3_bucket, "assets/demo-env-file.env")],
    secrets={# Retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store at container start-up.
        "SECRET": ecs.Secret.from_secrets_manager(secret),
        "DB_PASSWORD": ecs.Secret.from_secrets_manager(db_secret, "password"), # Reference a specific JSON field, (requires platform version 1.4.0 or later for Fargate tasks)
        "PARAMETER": ecs.Secret.from_ssm_parameter(parameter)}
)
```

The task execution role is automatically granted read permissions on the secrets/parameters. Support for environment
files is restricted to the EC2 launch type for files hosted on S3. Further details provided in the AWS documentation
about [specifying environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/taskdef-envfiles.html).

## Service

A `Service` instantiates a `TaskDefinition` on a `Cluster` a given number of
times, optionally associating them with a load balancer.
If a task fails,
Amazon ECS automatically restarts the task.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
task_definition =

service = ecs.FargateService(self, "Service",
    cluster=cluster,
    task_definition=task_definition,
    desired_count=5
)
```

`Services` by default will create a security group if not provided.
If you'd like to specify which security groups to use you can override the `securityGroups` property.

### Include an application/network load balancer

`Services` are load balancing targets and can be added to a target group, which will be attached to an application/network load balancers:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_elasticloadbalancingv2 as elbv2

service = ecs.FargateService(self, "Service")

lb = elbv2.ApplicationLoadBalancer(self, "LB", vpc=vpc, internet_facing=True)
listener = lb.add_listener("Listener", port=80)
target_group1 = listener.add_targets("ECS1",
    port=80,
    targets=[service]
)
target_group2 = listener.add_targets("ECS2",
    port=80,
    targets=[service.load_balancer_target(
        container_name="MyContainer",
        container_port=8080
    )]
)
```

Note that in the example above, the default `service` only allows you to register the first essential container or the first mapped port on the container as a target and add it to a new target group. To have more control over which container and port to register as targets, you can use `service.loadBalancerTarget()` to return a load balancing target for a specific container and port.

Alternatively, you can also create all load balancer targets to be registered in this service, add them to target groups, and attach target groups to listeners accordingly.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_elasticloadbalancingv2 as elbv2

service = ecs.FargateService(self, "Service")

lb = elbv2.ApplicationLoadBalancer(self, "LB", vpc=vpc, internet_facing=True)
listener = lb.add_listener("Listener", port=80)
service.register_load_balancer_targets(
    container_name="web",
    container_port=80,
    new_target_group_id="ECS",
    listener=ecs.ListenerConfig.application_listener(listener,
        protocol=elbv2.ApplicationProtocol.HTTPS
    )
)
```

### Using a Load Balancer from a different Stack

If you want to put your Load Balancer and the Service it is load balancing to in
different stacks, you may not be able to use the convenience methods
`loadBalancer.addListener()` and `listener.addTargets()`.

The reason is that these methods will create resources in the same Stack as the
object they're called on, which may lead to cyclic references between stacks.
Instead, you will have to create an `ApplicationListener` in the service stack,
or an empty `TargetGroup` in the load balancer stack that you attach your
service to.

See the [ecs/cross-stack-load-balancer example](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/tree/master/typescript/ecs/cross-stack-load-balancer/)
for the alternatives.

### Include a classic load balancer

`Services` can also be directly attached to a classic load balancer as targets:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_elasticloadbalancing as elb

service = ecs.Ec2Service(self, "Service")

lb = elb.LoadBalancer(stack, "LB", vpc=vpc)
lb.add_listener(external_port=80)
lb.add_target(service)
```

Similarly, if you want to have more control over load balancer targeting:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_elasticloadbalancing as elb

service = ecs.Ec2Service(self, "Service")

lb = elb.LoadBalancer(stack, "LB", vpc=vpc)
lb.add_listener(external_port=80)
lb.add_target(service.load_balancer_target,
    container_name="MyContainer",
    container_port=80
)
```

There are two higher-level constructs available which include a load balancer for you that can be found in the aws-ecs-patterns module:

* `LoadBalancedFargateService`
* `LoadBalancedEc2Service`

## Task Auto-Scaling

You can configure the task count of a service to match demand. Task auto-scaling is
configured by calling `autoScaleTaskCount()`:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
scaling = service.auto_scale_task_count(max_capacity=10)
scaling.scale_on_cpu_utilization("CpuScaling",
    target_utilization_percent=50
)

scaling.scale_on_request_count("RequestScaling",
    requests_per_target=10000,
    target_group=target
)
```

Task auto-scaling is powered by *Application Auto-Scaling*.
See that section for details.

## Instance Auto-Scaling

If you're running on AWS Fargate, AWS manages the physical machines that your
containers are running on for you. If you're running an Amazon ECS cluster however,
your Amazon EC2 instances might fill up as your number of Tasks goes up.

To avoid placement errors, configure auto-scaling for your
Amazon EC2 instance group so that your instance count scales with demand. To keep
your Amazon EC2 instances halfway loaded, scaling up to a maximum of 30 instances
if required:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
auto_scaling_group = cluster.add_capacity("DefaultAutoScalingGroup",
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t2.xlarge"),
    min_capacity=3,
    max_capacity=30,
    desired_capacity=3,

    # Give instances 5 minutes to drain running tasks when an instance is
    # terminated. This is the default, turn this off by specifying 0 or
    # change the timeout up to 900 seconds.
    task_drain_time=Duration.seconds(300)
)

auto_scaling_group.scale_on_cpu_utilization("KeepCpuHalfwayLoaded",
    target_utilization_percent=50
)
```

See the `@aws-cdk/aws-autoscaling` library for more autoscaling options
you can configure on your instances.

## Integration with CloudWatch Events

To start an Amazon ECS task on an Amazon EC2-backed Cluster, instantiate an
`@aws-cdk/aws-events-targets.EcsTask` instead of an `Ec2Service`:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_events_targets as targets

# Create a Task Definition for the container to start
task_definition = ecs.Ec2TaskDefinition(self, "TaskDef")
task_definition.add_container("TheContainer",
    image=ecs.ContainerImage.from_asset(path.resolve(__dirname, "..", "eventhandler-image")),
    memory_limit_mi_b=256,
    logging=ecs.AwsLogDriver(stream_prefix="EventDemo")
)

# An Rule that describes the event trigger (in this case a scheduled run)
rule = events.Rule(self, "Rule",
    schedule=events.Schedule.expression("rate(1 min)")
)

# Pass an environment variable to the container 'TheContainer' in the task
rule.add_target(targets.EcsTask(
    cluster=cluster,
    task_definition=task_definition,
    task_count=1,
    container_overrides=[ContainerOverride(
        container_name="TheContainer",
        environment=[TaskEnvironmentVariable(
            name="I_WAS_TRIGGERED",
            value="From CloudWatch Events"
        )]
    )]
))
```

        """The properties for adding instance capacity to an AutoScalingGroup.

        :param can_containers_access_instance_role: Specifies whether the containers can access the container instance role. Default: false
        :param machine_image_type: Specify the machine image type. Default: MachineImageType.AMAZON_LINUX_2
        :param spot_instance_draining: Specify whether to enable Automated Draining for Spot Instances running Amazon ECS Services. For more information, see `Using Spot Instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-spot.html>`_. Default: false
        :param task_drain_time: The time period to wait before force terminating an instance that is draining. This creates a Lambda function that is used by a lifecycle hook for the AutoScalingGroup that will delay instance termination until all ECS tasks have drained from the instance. Set to 0 to disable task draining. Set to 0 to disable task draining. Default: Duration.minutes(5)
        :param topic_encryption_key: If {@link AddAutoScalingGroupCapacityOptions.taskDrainTime} is non-zero, then the ECS cluster creates an SNS Topic to as part of a system to drain instances of tasks when the instance is being shut down. If this property is provided, then this key will be used to encrypt the contents of that SNS Topic. See `SNS Data Encryption <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-data-encryption.html>`_ for more information. Default: The SNS Topic will not be encrypted.
        :param allow_all_outbound: Whether the instances can initiate connections to anywhere by default. Default: true
        :param associate_public_ip_address: Whether instances in the Auto Scaling Group should have public IP addresses associated with them. Default: - Use subnet setting.
        :param auto_scaling_group_name: The name of the Auto Scaling group. This name must be unique per Region per account. Default: - Auto generated by CloudFormation
        :param block_devices: Specifies how block devices are exposed to the instance. You can specify virtual devices and EBS volumes. Each instance that is launched has an associated root device volume, either an Amazon EBS volume or an instance store volume. You can use block device mappings to specify additional EBS volumes or instance store volumes to attach to an instance when it is launched. Default: - Uses the block device mapping of the AMI
        :param cooldown: Default scaling cooldown for this AutoScalingGroup. Default: Duration.minutes(5)
        :param desired_capacity: Initial amount of instances in the fleet. If this is set to a number, every deployment will reset the amount of instances to this number. It is recommended to leave this value blank. Default: minCapacity, and leave unchanged during deployment
        :param group_metrics: Enable monitoring for group metrics, these metrics describe the group rather than any of its instances. To report all group metrics use ``GroupMetrics.all()`` Group metrics are reported in a granularity of 1 minute at no additional charge. Default: - no group metrics will be reported
        :param health_check: Configuration for health checks. Default: - HealthCheck.ec2 with no grace period
        :param ignore_unmodified_size_properties: If the ASG has scheduled actions, don't reset unchanged group sizes. Only used if the ASG has scheduled actions (which may scale your ASG up or down regardless of cdk deployments). If true, the size of the group will only be reset if it has been changed in the CDK app. If false, the sizes will always be changed back to what they were in the CDK app on deployment. Default: true
        :param instance_monitoring: Controls whether instances in this group are launched with detailed or basic monitoring. When detailed monitoring is enabled, Amazon CloudWatch generates metrics every minute and your account is charged a fee. When you disable detailed monitoring, CloudWatch generates metrics every 5 minutes. Default: - Monitoring.DETAILED
        :param key_name: Name of SSH keypair to grant access to instances. Default: - No SSH access will be possible.
        :param max_capacity: Maximum number of instances in the fleet. Default: desiredCapacity
        :param max_instance_lifetime: The maximum amount of time that an instance can be in service. The maximum duration applies to all current and future instances in the group. As an instance approaches its maximum duration, it is terminated and replaced, and cannot be used again. You must specify a value of at least 604,800 seconds (7 days). To clear a previously set value, leave this property undefined. Default: none
        :param min_capacity: Minimum number of instances in the fleet. Default: 1
        :param notifications: Configure autoscaling group to send notifications about fleet changes to an SNS topic(s). Default: - No fleet change notifications will be sent.
        :param notifications_topic: (deprecated) SNS topic to send notifications about fleet changes. Default: - No fleet change notifications will be sent.
        :param replacing_update_min_successful_instances_percent: (deprecated) Configuration for replacing updates. Only used if updateType == UpdateType.ReplacingUpdate. Specifies how many instances must signal success for the update to succeed. Default: minSuccessfulInstancesPercent
        :param resource_signal_count: (deprecated) How many ResourceSignal calls CloudFormation expects before the resource is considered created. Default: 1 if resourceSignalTimeout is set, 0 otherwise
        :param resource_signal_timeout: (deprecated) The length of time to wait for the resourceSignalCount. The maximum value is 43200 (12 hours). Default: Duration.minutes(5) if resourceSignalCount is set, N/A otherwise
        :param rolling_update_configuration: (deprecated) Configuration for rolling updates. Only used if updateType == UpdateType.RollingUpdate. Default: - RollingUpdateConfiguration with defaults.
        :param signals: Configure waiting for signals during deployment. Use this to pause the CloudFormation deployment to wait for the instances in the AutoScalingGroup to report successful startup during creation and updates. The UserData script needs to invoke ``cfn-signal`` with a success or failure code after it is done setting up the instance. Without waiting for signals, the CloudFormation deployment will proceed as soon as the AutoScalingGroup has been created or updated but before the instances in the group have been started. For example, to have instances wait for an Elastic Load Balancing health check before they signal success, add a health-check verification by using the cfn-init helper script. For an example, see the verify_instance_health command in the Auto Scaling rolling updates sample template: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates/blob/master/aws/services/AutoScaling/AutoScalingRollingUpdates.yaml Default: - Do not wait for signals
        :param spot_price: The maximum hourly price (in USD) to be paid for any Spot Instance launched to fulfill the request. Spot Instances are launched when the price you specify exceeds the current Spot market price. Default: none
        :param update_policy: What to do when an AutoScalingGroup's instance configuration is changed. This is applied when any of the settings on the ASG are changed that affect how the instances should be created (VPC, instance type, startup scripts, etc.). It indicates how the existing instances should be replaced with new instances matching the new config. By default, nothing is done and only new instances are launched with the new config. Default: - ``UpdatePolicy.rollingUpdate()`` if using ``init``, ``UpdatePolicy.none()`` otherwise
        :param update_type: (deprecated) What to do when an AutoScalingGroup's instance configuration is changed. This is applied when any of the settings on the ASG are changed that affect how the instances should be created (VPC, instance type, startup scripts, etc.). It indicates how the existing instances should be replaced with new instances matching the new config. By default, nothing is done and only new instances are launched with the new config. Default: UpdateType.None
        :param vpc_subnets: Where to place instances within the VPC. Default: - All Private subnets.
        :param instance_type: The EC2 instance type to use when launching instances into the AutoScalingGroup.
        :param machine_image: The ECS-optimized AMI variant to use. For more information, see `Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html>`_. You must define either ``machineImage`` or ``machineImageType``, not both. Default: - Amazon Linux 2

At least one of memoryLimitMiB and memoryReservationMiB is required for non-Fargate services. Default: - No memory limit.
        :param memory_reservation_mib: The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the container. When system memory is under heavy contention, Docker attempts to keep the container memory to this soft limit. However, your container can consume more memory when it needs to, up to either the hard limit specified with the memory parameter (if applicable), or all of the available memory on the container instance, whichever comes first. At least one of memoryLimitMiB and memoryReservationMiB is required for non-Fargate services. Default: - No memory reserved.

Other repositories are specified with either repository-url/image:tag or repository-url/image@digest. TODO: Update these to specify using classes of IContainerImage
        :param command: The command that is passed to the container. If you provide a shell command as a single string, you have to quote command-line arguments. Default: - CMD value built into container image.
        :param cpu: The minimum number of CPU units to reserve for the container. Default: - No minimum CPU units reserved.
        :param disable_networking: Specifies whether networking is disabled within the container. When this parameter is true, networking is disabled within the container. Default: false
        :param dns_search_domains: A list of DNS search domains that are presented to the container. Default: - No search domains.
        :param dns_servers: A list of DNS servers that are presented to the container. Default: - Default DNS servers.
        :param docker_labels: A key/value map of labels to add to the container. Default: - No labels.
        :param docker_security_options: A list of strings to provide custom labels for SELinux and AppArmor multi-level security systems. Default: - No security labels.
        :param entry_point: The ENTRYPOINT value to pass to the container. Default: - Entry point configured in container.
        :param environment: The environment variables to pass to the container. Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_files: The environment files to pass to the container. Default: - No environment files.
        :param essential: Specifies whether the container is marked essential. If the essential parameter of a container is marked as true, and that container fails or stops for any reason, all other containers that are part of the task are stopped. If the essential parameter of a container is marked as false, then its failure does not affect the rest of the containers in a task. All tasks must have at least one essential container. If this parameter is omitted, a container is assumed to be essential. Default: true
        :param extra_hosts: A list of hostnames and IP address mappings to append to the /etc/hosts file on the container. Default: - No extra hosts.
        :param gpu_count: The number of GPUs assigned to the container. Default: - No GPUs assigned.
        :param health_check: The health check command and associated configuration parameters for the container. Default: - Health check configuration from container.
        :param hostname: The hostname to use for your container. Default: - Automatic hostname.
        :param linux_parameters: Linux-specific modifications that are applied to the container, such as Linux kernel capabilities. For more information see `KernelCapabilities <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_KernelCapabilities.html>`_. Default: - No Linux parameters.
        :param logging: The log configuration specification for the container. Default: - Containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses.
        :param memory_limit_mib: The amount (in MiB) of memory to present to the container. If your container attempts to exceed the allocated memory, the container is terminated. At least one of memoryLimitMiB and memoryReservationMiB is required for non-Fargate services. Default: - No memory limit.
        :param memory_reservation_mib: The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the container. When system memory is under heavy contention, Docker attempts to keep the container memory to this soft limit. However, your container can consume more memory when it needs to, up to either the hard limit specified with the memory parameter (if applicable), or all of the available memory on the container instance, whichever comes first. At least one of memoryLimitMiB and memoryReservationMiB is required for non-Fargate services. Default: - No memory reserved.

Other repositories are specified with either repository-url/image:tag or repository-url/image@digest. TODO: Update these to specify using classes of IContainerImage
        :param command: The command that is passed to the container. If you provide a shell command as a single string, you have to quote command-line arguments. Default: - CMD value built into container image.
        :param cpu: The minimum number of CPU units to reserve for the container. Default: - No minimum CPU units reserved.
        :param disable_networking: Specifies whether networking is disabled within the container. When this parameter is true, networking is disabled within the container. Default: false
        :param dns_search_domains: A list of DNS search domains that are presented to the container. Default: - No search domains.
        :param dns_servers: A list of DNS servers that are presented to the container. Default: - Default DNS servers.

        :param environment_files: The environment files to pass to the container. Default: - No environment files.
        :param essential: Specifies whether the container is marked essential. If the essential parameter of a container is marked as true, and that container fails or stops for any reason, all other containers that are part of the task are stopped. If the essential parameter of a container is marked as false, then its failure does not affect the rest of the containers in a task. All tasks must have at least one essential container. If this parameter is omitted, a container is assumed to be essential. Default: true

At least one of memoryLimitMiB and memoryReservationMiB is required for non-Fargate services. Default: - No memory limit.
        :param memory_reservation_mib: The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the container. When system memory is under heavy contention, Docker attempts to keep the container memory to this soft limit. However, your container can consume more memory when it needs to, up to either the hard limit specified with the memory parameter (if applicable), or all of the available memory on the container instance, whichever comes first. At least one of memoryLimitMiB and memoryReservationMiB is required for non-Fargate services. Default: - No memory reserved.

At least one of memoryLimitMiB and memoryReservationMiB is required for non-Fargate services. Default: - No memory limit.
        :param memory_reservation_mib: The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the container. When system memory is under heavy contention, Docker attempts to keep the container memory to this soft limit. However, your container can consume more memory when it needs to, up to either the hard limit specified with the memory parameter (if applicable), or all of the available memory on the container instance, whichever comes first. At least one of memoryLimitMiB and memoryReservationMiB is required for non-Fargate services. Default: - No memory reserved.

        :param block_devices: Specifies how block devices are exposed to the instance. You can specify virtual devices and EBS volumes. Each instance that is launched has an associated root device volume, either an Amazon EBS volume or an instance store volume. You can use block device mappings to specify additional EBS volumes or instance store volumes to attach to an instance when it is launched. Default: - Uses the block device mapping of the AMI
        :param cooldown: Default scaling cooldown for this AutoScalingGroup. Default: Duration.minutes(5)
        :param desired_capacity: Initial amount of instances in the fleet. If this is set to a number, every deployment will reset the amount of instances to this number. It is recommended to leave this value blank. Default: minCapacity, and leave unchanged during deployment
        :param group_metrics: Enable monitoring for group metrics, these metrics describe the group rather than any of its instances. To report all group metrics use ``GroupMetrics.all()`` Group metrics are reported in a granularity of 1 minute at no additional charge. Default: - no group metrics will be reported

Only used if the ASG has scheduled actions (which may scale your ASG up or down regardless of cdk deployments). If true, the size of the group will only be reset if it has been changed in the CDK app. If false, the sizes will always be changed back to what they were in the CDK app on deployment. Default: true
        :param instance_monitoring: Controls whether instances in this group are launched with detailed or basic monitoring. When detailed monitoring is enabled, Amazon CloudWatch generates metrics every minute and your account is charged a fee. When you disable detailed monitoring, CloudWatch generates metrics every 5 minutes. Default: - Monitoring.DETAILED
        :param key_name: Name of SSH keypair to grant access to instances. Default: - No SSH access will be possible.
        :param max_capacity: Maximum number of instances in the fleet. Default: desiredCapacity
        :param max_instance_lifetime: The maximum amount of time that an instance can be in service. The maximum duration applies to all current and future instances in the group. As an instance approaches its maximum duration, it is terminated and replaced, and cannot be used again. You must specify a value of at least 604,800 seconds (7 days). To clear a previously set value, leave this property undefined. Default: none
        :param min_capacity: Minimum number of instances in the fleet. Default: 1
        :param notifications: Configure autoscaling group to send notifications about fleet changes to an SNS topic(s). Default: - No fleet change notifications will be sent.
        :param notifications_topic: (deprecated) SNS topic to send notifications about fleet changes. Default: - No fleet change notifications will be sent.
        :param replacing_update_min_successful_instances_percent: (deprecated) Configuration for replacing updates. Only used if updateType == UpdateType.ReplacingUpdate. Specifies how many instances must signal success for the update to succeed. Default: minSuccessfulInstancesPercent
        :param resource_signal_count: (deprecated) How many ResourceSignal calls CloudFormation expects before the resource is considered created. Default: 1 if resourceSignalTimeout is set, 0 otherwise
        :param resource_signal_timeout: (deprecated) The length of time to wait for the resourceSignalCount. The maximum value is 43200 (12 hours). Default: Duration.minutes(5) if resourceSignalCount is set, N/A otherwise
        :param rolling_update_configuration: (deprecated) Configuration for rolling updates. Only used if updateType == UpdateType.RollingUpdate. Default: - RollingUpdateConfiguration with defaults.
        :param signals: Configure waiting for signals during deployment. Use this to pause the CloudFormation deployment to wait for the instances in the AutoScalingGroup to report successful startup during creation and updates. The UserData script needs to invoke ``cfn-signal`` with a success or failure code after it is done setting up the instance. Without waiting for signals, the CloudFormation deployment will proceed as soon as the AutoScalingGroup has been created or updated but before the instances in the group have been started. For example, to have instances wait for an Elastic Load Balancing health check before they signal success, add a health-check verification by using the cfn-init helper script. For an example, see the verify_instance_health command in the Auto Scaling rolling updates sample template: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates/blob/master/aws/services/AutoScaling/AutoScalingRollingUpdates.yaml Default: - Do not wait for signals
        :param spot_price: The maximum hourly price (in USD) to be paid for any Spot Instance launched to fulfill the request. Spot Instances are launched when the price you specify exceeds the current Spot market price. Default: none
        :param update_policy: What to do when an AutoScalingGroup's instance configuration is changed. This is applied when any of the settings on the ASG are changed that affect how the instances should be created (VPC, instance type, startup scripts, etc.). It indicates how the existing instances should be replaced with new instances matching the new config. By default, nothing is done and only new instances are launched with the new config. Default: - ``UpdatePolicy.rollingUpdate()`` if using ``init``, ``UpdatePolicy.none()`` otherwise
        :param update_type: (deprecated) What to do when an AutoScalingGroup's instance configuration is changed. This is applied when any of the settings on the ASG are changed that affect how the instances should be created (VPC, instance type, startup scripts, etc.). It indicates how the existing instances should be replaced with new instances matching the new config. By default, nothing is done and only new instances are launched with the new config.
